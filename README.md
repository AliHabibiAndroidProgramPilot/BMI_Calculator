## This repository contains the source code for a simple and user-friendly BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator app for Android.

**What is BMI?**

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a common measure of body fat based on a person's weight and height. It's a simple calculation that can be used as a screening tool to identify potential weight problems in adults. However, it's important to note that BMI doesn't account for factors like muscle mass and bone density, so it may not be entirely accurate for everyone.

This app allows users to calculate their BMI by entering their height and weight.

Calculates BMI based on user input.
Displays the calculated BMI value and its corresponding category (Underweight, Normal Weight, Overweight, Obese).
